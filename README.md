# Panel Script
This script was made for Adobe Photoshop. The goal is to create a layout of
panels indicating where an image will be cut and where the 2" overlap will
be( in red ). Each panel cannot exceed 53" wide including the 2" overlap.

After that the number of panels that it will be cut into and the panel widths
are displayed in a popup.

The file is automatically saved into our specified directory with the "panels"
suffix.

## New Things
This script was created using the Extendscriptr module to compile ES2015 to
useable javascript for the Adobe Suite.
